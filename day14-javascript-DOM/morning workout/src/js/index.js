/* Change your application so that after asking for the account number it asks the user for an action. If the action is "balance", output the balance on the account as before. If the action is something else, output "Unknown action."
Add another action to our application called "withdraw". If the user chooses this action, they will be asked to input an amount of money to withdraw from their account. When you have the information subtract the withdrawn money from the correct account. If the account does not have enough money output an error like "Not enough money on your account." */
